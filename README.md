# Game Guidelines/ How to play:

Once the player clicks the START QUIZ button, the player is presented with a series of javascript questions, testing the players knowledge of the programming language. Player will see a 90 sec timer start to countdown, letting them know the game has begun. 

The score is calculated by the amount of time remaining at the end of the quiz. Thus, answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 10 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
